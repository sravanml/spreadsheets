# Google Sheets Basics Explained

## Spreadsheet Basics:
- Google Sheets is like a big table where you can write and organize information neatly. You use rows and columns to make your table, just like in a notebook. You can change how your writing looks, like making it bold or changing the color. Also, you can do math calculations easily, like adding numbers or finding averages, using special formulas.

## Variables in Google Sheets:
- Think of variables as boxes where you can keep different numbers. In Google Sheets, you can put numbers in these boxes and use them in your calculations. For example, if you have a box for "number of apples" and another box for "price per apple," you can use these boxes to find the total cost of all the apples you bought.

## Shortcuts for Efficiency:
- Shortcuts are like secret codes that help you do things faster. Instead of clicking many times with your mouse, you can press a few keys on your keyboard to do the same thing. For example, pressing Ctrl+C copies text, and Ctrl+V pastes it. Learning these shortcuts can save you a lot of time when working on your Google Sheets projects.
